# x86_64-specific targets and configuration.

# "The -mcmodel=large argument enables us to run the kernel at any 64-bit
#  virtual memory address we want. In fact, using the 'large' code model is
#  discouraged due to its inefficiency, but it can be fine as a start. Check
#  the SysV AMD64 ABI document for extra details."

#
# -mno-red-zone: Disables the AMD64 ABI 128-byte "red zone", which resides
#                below the stack pointer. Without this, the kernel is
#                interrupt-unsafe.
# -mno-mmx: Disable SIMD instructions for now.
# -mno-sse -mno-sse2: Disable SSE floating-point operations because they
#                     need additional setup we are not currently doing.
